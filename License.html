<h2>Introduction</h2>
-->

<p>This license ensures a couple of things that are for your benefit:
<ul>
	<li>The software must always be distributed packaged with it's
	documentation and any other support files.</li> 
	
	<li>Nobody can attempt to rip you off by charging a fee for the
	software.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It also ensures a few things that are important to me:
<ul>
	<li>Nobody else can claim credit for my software.</li>
	
	<li>Nobody can change my software and then blame me when it doesn't
	work.</li>
	
	<li>If somebody wants to use my software as part of their own work,
	they have to ask my permission first.</li>
	
	<li>There's no warranty on my software.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you're into <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/license-list.html">licenses</a>,
you'll realise that this license qualifies as free-as-in-beer, but not
free-as-in-speech.  In particular it only grants <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">freedoms zero to
two</a> as defined by the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/fsf/fsf.html">Free
Software Foundation</a>.  With this license I've reserved the right to
grant freedom three at my option.</p>
